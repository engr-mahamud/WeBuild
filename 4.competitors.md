# Who are your competitors, and who might become your competitors?

This is a very new idea, even if we go for the world scale. In the world, the number of concrete printers is still countable numbers and most of them belong to researchers under different universities. And there are some on-request printers are also available in some countries. So the market is still a baby-market and the prospect is sky-high. So in a nutshell, all our competitors will be from the international territory. Some present 3D concrete printer solutions are as follows:
