# Who are your competitors, and who might become your competitors?

This is a very new idea, even if we go for the world scale. In the world the number of concrete printers are still countable numbers and most of them belongs to researchers under different universities. And there are some on request printers are also available in some countries. So the market is a just born market and the prospect is sky high. Some present solutions are as follows:
