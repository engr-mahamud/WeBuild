## Select a category from below for your idea *
Bangladesh is now going through it's developing stage under the leadership of our **Honorable Visionary Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina**. So many Mega-projects are ongoing. Most of the projects are for infrastructure development i.e. **_Construction Projects_**.
As a Civil Engineer, I know how much we are lagging behind from the world in the Construction industry from the International standard. So to overcome this situation, my solution is `3D Concrete Printer`.
Okey 3D Concrete Printer; but how it can help?
1. It can help by minimizing the time,
2. It can help by minimizing the risks of accident,
3. It can help by minimizing the waste,
4. It can help by minimizing the adverse environmental effect,
5. It can help by minimizing cost, etc.
This can be the perfect solution for enterprises using construction projects all over Bangladesh. Our initial target will be the companies doing static projects; especially Real Estate Developers.

## Now describe the idea *
`Now tell us how you got the idea, the problem you are solving, the improvement of life style/business you are thinking of, the plan/solution you are proposing, why your idea is unique, or something else you would like to share. If you could share some data, that would be fantastic!`

# Project Name: WeBuild

## About the Project: A Concrete 3D printer
By this time we all know about the idea of 3D printing. In short, it uses plastic instead of ink and it prints on the printer base so that we get our desired plastic product prototype. Nowadays the 3D print is providing solutions for many critical industries. From making a low-cost prototype of a product for testing before mass production to printing organs to transplant on the Human body.

So imagine if we can use this technology to improve our Construction Industry which is basically slow & laborious and most of the time it is not in touch of recent technologies, especially in Bangladesh.

## Constraints:
Main constraints for this project are listed below:

1. Make the printer large enough to print an ‘Entire House’, which includes the selection of the printer type, find the optimum size of the printer and customized programming of the printer,
2. Design the proper Concrete Mix-design to use with the printer,
3. Design a printable structure, and finally
4. Start printing.

### How to Solve the Problems: Size of the printer
The main problem is the printer size. First, we need to make one scaled-down prototype for the printer. After the successful run of the small printer, we can go for the live sized printer.

### How to Solve the Problems: Type of the printer
To make this project live, there are two options for the type of printer.
1. Robotic arm printer,
2. Gantry printer.

We need to finalize the type of printer after detailed testing of both the options.

### How to Solve the Problems: Customized programming for the printer
Our plan is to use Arduino to control the printer. Arduino is our first choice because of its versatile applicability with simplicity.

### How to Solve the Problems: Concrete Mix-Design & Design of Structure
These are the simplest of all the constraints. Preparing of concrete mix-design will involve some trial and error process to finalize; which time-consuming but quite simple procedure. And finally the design of the structure is quite straight forward; nothing much to say.

So, let’s print some Houses to move in.
