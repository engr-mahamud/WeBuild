# Now describe the idea

Project Name: WeBuild
About the Project: A Concrete 3D printer
By this time we all know about the idea of 3D printing. In short, it uses plastic instead of ink and it prints on the printer base so that we get our desired plastic product prototype. Nowadays the 3D print is providing solutions for many critical industries. From making a low-cost prototype of a product for testing before mass production to printing organs to transplant on the Human body.

So imagine if we can use this technology to revolutionize our Construction Industry which is basically slow, laborious & accident-prone and most of the time it is not in touch of recent technologies, especially in Bangladesh.

Imagine a construction site. What can you see?
Chaos? Why this chaos? Because of the large number of workforce, machinery, equipment, accidents, everything. And finally, it'll take a very long time to construct.
Now imagine the same construction site with workforce & accidents as minimal as possible and construction work is doing by 'Construction robots'. Too futuristic? Maybe, but achievable if we start trying.
Now the 3D printed buildings are not fictional things, its pretty common. The first 3D printed building was in Dubai which took only one week to complete the total construction of a 3D rendered building. And from planning, setup, and everything, the total time it took is one month.
Not only Dubai, but China also started printing buildings. They've printed one 5 storied building and a mansion, which are the tallest 3D printed buildings till date. They printed 'Ten houses under 24 hours' before that. Not only buildings, there are other 3D printed structures, like bridges, culverts, etc. also present in different countries of the world.

What are the advantages of 3D printed buildings?
Construction can be done within less time, with less equipment, with less workforce, with proper utilization of materials & resources and with minimal environmental impact. Sounds good?

So, why waiting! letâ€™s print some Houses to move in.
