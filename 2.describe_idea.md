# Now describe the idea *

Imagine a construction site. What can you see?
Chaos? Why this chaos? Because of the large number of work force, machinery, equipment, accidents, everything. And finally it'll took a very long time to construct.
Now imagine the same construction site with work force & accidents as minimal as possible and construction work is doing by 'Construction robots'. Too futuristic? May be, but achieveable if we start trying.
Now the 3D printed buildings are not fictional things, its pretty common. The first 3D printed building was in Dubai which took only One week to complete the total construction of a 3D rendered building. And from planning, setup and everything, it took total one month.
Not only Dubai, China also started printing buildings. They've printed one 5 storied building and a mansion, which are the tallest 3D printed buildings till date. They printed 'Ten houses under 24 hours' before that. Not only buildings, there are other 3D printed structures, like bridges, culverts, etc. also present at different countries of the world.

What are the advantages of 3D printed buildings?
Construction can be done with in less time, with less equipment, with less work force, with proper utilization of materials & resources and with minimal environmental impact. Sounds good?
