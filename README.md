# Project Name: WeBuild
Repository for the WeBuild Project for applying for RobiVentures. All ideas, resources, etc. will be listed here.

## About the Project: A Concrete 3D printer
By this time we all know about the idea of 3D printing. In short, it uses plastic instead of ink and it prints on the printer base so that we get our desired plastic product prototype. Now a days the 3D print is solution for many critical branches of the industry. From making prototype of a product before mass production to printing organs to transplant on Human body.

So imagine if we can use this technology to improve our Construction Industry which is basically slow & laborous and most of the time it is not in touch of recent technologies, specially in Bangladesh.

## Constraints:
Main constraints for this project are listed below:
1. Make the printer large enough to print an 'Entire House', which includes selection of the printer type, find the optimum size of the printer and customized programming of the printer,
2. Design the proper Concrete Mix-design to use with the printer, 
3. Design a printable structure, and finally
4. Start printing.

### How to Solve the Problems: Size of the printer
The main problem is the printer size. First we need to make one scaled down prototype for the printer. After successful run of the small printer we can go for the live sized printer.

### How to Solve the Problems: Type of the printer
To make this project live, there are two options for the type of printer.
1. Robotic arm printer,
2. Gantry printer.
We need to finalize the type of printer after detailed testing of both the options.

### How to Solve the Problems: Customized programming for the printer
Our plan is to use Arduino to control the printer. Arduino is our first choice because of it's versatile applocability with simplicity.

### How to Solve the Problems: Concrete Mix-Design & Design of Structure
These are the simplest of all the constraints. Preparing of comcrete mix-design will involve some trial and error process to finalize; which time-consuming but quite simple procedure.
And finally the design of structure is quite straight forward; nothing much to say.

So, let's print some Houses to live in.
