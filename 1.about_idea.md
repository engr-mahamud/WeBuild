Bangladesh is now going through it's developing stage under the leadership of our **Honourable Visionary Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina**. So many Mega-projects are ongoing. Most of the projects are for infrastructure development i.e. **_Construction Projects_**.
As a Civil Engineer, I know how much we are lagging behind from the world in the Construction industry from the International standard. So to overcome this situation, my solution is `3D Concrete Printer`.
Okey 3D Concrete Printer; but how it can help?
1. It can help by minimizing the time,
2. It can help by minimizing the risks of accident,
3. It can help by minimizing the waste,
4. It can help by minimizing the adverse environmental effect,
5. It can help by minimizing cost, etc.
This can be the perfect solution for enterprises using construction projects all over Bangladesh. Our initial target will be the companies doing static projects; especially Real Estate Developers.
